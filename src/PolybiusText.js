        A  Polybius Square cipher uses a 5x5 table to convert letters into number pairs. Ex: A Polybius Square will shift A to 11, M to 23, and X to 35. In order to fit all letters of the English alphabet into the 25 cell table, the letters "I" and "J" are combined and will display as "I/J." To decode successfully, each letter must be given as a valid Polybius number pair.

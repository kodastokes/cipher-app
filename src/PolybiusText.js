        A standard Polybius Square cipher uses a 5x5 table to convert letters into number. In order to fit all 26 letters of the English alphabet into the table, the letters "i" and "j" are combined into a single cell. When decoding with a Polybius Square, those letters will record as "i/j." For decoding, each letter must be given as a standard Polybius number pair.

        A Caesar Shift is a simple method of encoding messages where letters in
        the alphabet are shifted by a selected amount to yield an encoding
        alphabet. A Caesar cipher with a shift of 1 would encode an A as a B, an
        J as a K, and a Z as an A, and so on. When decoding, the reverse will
        happen.
